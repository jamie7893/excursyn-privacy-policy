**Privacy Policy**

At Excursyn, we take the privacy of our users seriously. This privacy policy describes how we collect, use, and protect the data that you provide to us through our app.

**Data Usage**

We collect and use data from our users for the sole purpose of providing and improving our app. We do not share or sell user data to third parties. We use data to operate and provide our services, including providing customer support, and to improve our app and user experience. We may use data to personalize the app for you and to provide advertising that may be of interest to you.

Camera Permission: Excursyn requires access to your device's camera to enable you to upload pictures directly through the app. These images may be used to show other users. We do not store or share these images without your explicit consent, except as necessary to provide the service you have requested.

**Data Retention**

We retain user data as long as the user is using the app. If a user deletes their account, we will delete their data from our systems, unless we are required by law to retain it.

**Security Measures**

We take the security of user data seriously and have implemented appropriate security measures to protect user data. We use industry-standard encryption, firewalls, and access controls to protect user data. Our app is hosted on secure servers provided by Heroku and Firebase.

**Third-Party Services**

We use third-party services to collect, store, and process user data, including Firebase and Heroku. These services have their own privacy policies and data practices, and we encourage you to review them.
